## Search Page
Users are directed to the major search form of the application. They can choose from a long list of major cities or enter their own specific location. The user is required to enter a location in one of these two ways to submit the form. Otherwise, an error will be alerted. The user can also specify distance, time period, sorting parameters, and max results.

## Results Page
Powered by the eventbrite API, events in the users' specified locations and times are appended to the page. Users can view a title, photo, truncated description, and a URL. They can link to the event in a new tab to take further action. The "Search Again!" buttons redirect to a cleared Search Page.
